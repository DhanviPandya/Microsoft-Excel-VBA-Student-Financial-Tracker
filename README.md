# Student-Financial-Tracker
Created an innovative financial planning tool in Excel tailored for university students, enabling streamlined and automated personal financial management while tracking debt, income, expenses, and savings and investment goals. 

Achieved this by: 

•	Utilizing VBA programming to develop complex macros which resulted in improved tool efficiency by automating repetitive tasks such as income and expense calculations. 

•	Designing multi - sheet workbooks which take user input through forms and pop-ups for data collection and analysis

•	Conducting a sensitivity analysis to test the final product and assist in making informed decisions on uncertainties in financial scenarios
